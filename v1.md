# Code Your Future

Code Your Future is a charity, originally set up in London, but now also with a presence across the UK (in the West Midlands, Glasgow, Manchester), and beyond (Rome).

It aims to help people to learn coding skills, as well as to help to developp them as people, to get them into jobs

CYF has graduates working at the FT, BBC, STV, Ticketmaster, and more.

If you want to volunteer, there are many roles available - you need to have a technical background!
