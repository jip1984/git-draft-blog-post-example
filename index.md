# Code Your Future

Code Your Future is a charity, originally set up in London, but now also with a presence across the UK (in the West Midlands, Glasgow, Manchester) and beyond (Rome, Cape Town).

It aims to help people to learn coding skills, as well as to help to develop them as people, to get them into jobs.

We have taught hundreds of learners through our course.

CYF has graduates working at the FT, BBC, STV, Ticketmaster, Adzuna and more.

If you want to volunteer, there are many roles available - you don't need to have a technical background!
